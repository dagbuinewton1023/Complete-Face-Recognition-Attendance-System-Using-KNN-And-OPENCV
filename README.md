# Complete-Face-Recognition-Attendance-System-Using-KNN-And-OPENCV

This project presents a Complete Face Recognition Attendance System utilizing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and OpenCV. The system captures real-time video from a webcam, detects faces using Haar cascades, and classifies recognized individuals using a trained KNN model. The recognized individuals' names and timestamps are automatically stored in a CSV-based attendance log. The model is trained using pre-saved facial datasets, which are serialized using pickle for efficient storage and retrieval. This implementation provides a simple, efficient, and scalable approach to automating attendance tracking in educational institutions, workplaces, and other environments requiring identity verification.

Installation
To run this project, install the following dependencies using pip:
-pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn pandas

Also download all the files provided in this repository and put all in a folder with your choice of naming
Open that entire folder in your code editor and create two folders thus "data" and "Attendance"
Run the dataset.py file to capture the details of your face for the training after it is successful
Run the Attendance.py file to test if your capture.


for the Attendance.py program use the below to find your way through
Press "o to log attendance.
Press "q to exit the system.


Enjoy! :)
